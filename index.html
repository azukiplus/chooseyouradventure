    <p class="scenario">
      The room is silent except the soft taps of your favorite pen against the
      cherry wood desk. <em>*tap, tap, tap... *</em> Out the blinds, you notice
      the rain pouring so hard that it feels like the earth is crying. A sudden
      shrill ring of the phone interrupts your thoughts.
    </p>
    <button class="choice-2">Pick up the phone</button>
    <button class="choice-3">Ignore the phone</button>
  </div>
  <div id="scene-2">
    <p class="scenario">
      You pick up the phone and a scratchy, panicked voice greets you. For a reason
      unbeknownst to you, a feeling of despair fills you to the brim. "I've got a
      case for you," he shouts, panting and out of breath. Your head starts to hurt.
      You have a premonition that something is about to go very wrong.
    </p>
    <button class="choice-5">Say: "What do you mean, a case?"</button>
    <button class="choice-6">End the call</button>
  </div>
  <div id="scene-3">
    <p class="scenario">
      You let the phone keep ringing. Something deep inside you tells you that
      you <em>need</em> to pick up the phone. Why don't I try picking up the phone?
    </p>
    <button class="choice-2">Pick up the phone</button>
    <button class="choice-4">Ignore the phone</button>
  </div>
  <div id="scene-4">
    <p class="scenario">
      Minutes later, the phone stops ringing and only the sound of you tapping your pen
      remains. <em>tap, tap, tap...</em> You close your eyes, starting to drift off
      peacefully... when the shrill screech of the phone ringing once again blasts your
      unsuspecting ears.

    <button class="choice-2">Pick up the phone</button>
    <button class="choice-3">Ignore the phone</button>

  <div id="scene-5">
    <p class="scenario">
      "What do you mean, <em>"What do you mean?"</em> the voice hisses at you. "You're a
      detective, aren't you? I want you to solve the murder case of my son."
    </p>
    <button class="choice-9">Accept the case</button>
    <button class="choice-8">Decline the case</button>

  <div id="scene-6">
    <p class="scenario">
      Your finger trembles on the *end call* button, but you can't bring yourself to press
      the button.

    <h2>[Ending 1 reached.]</h2>
    <p class="ending">
      The call ends, and you're left with a sense of emptiness. Was that truly the correct
      decision, or did I make a mistake?

  </div>
  <div id="scene-8">
    <h2>[Ending 2 reached.]</h2>
    <p class="ending">
      You decline to help with the case. Without another word, the man ends the call, and you're

  <div id="scene-9">
    <p class="scenario">
      You accept the case. The man breathes a sigh of relief, then suddenly goes silent.
      Only his muffled breathing and wet footsteps can be heard from the phone. The
      footsteps slow to a halt. "I was watched him do it," he whispers, trembling.
      "He hit my son with a pipe, and all I could do was watch. I was too scared to move.
      I couldn't protect my own son."

      works in this area. Help me find my son's murderer. Please."

      You're hit with a wave of pain as your headache worsens. Are you really going to be able to
      help solve a case of this caliber in your current state?
    </p>
    <button class="choice-14">Say: "Ok, I'll do everything I can to find him."</button>

  <div id="scene-11">
    <p class="scenario">
      You think as hard as you can, but your headache starts to get worse.
      Memories about the past hour race through your mind. Darkness, sudden
      bright flashes, and... running for your life. You start to feel sick.

  <div id="scene-12">
    <p class="scenario">
      You end the call to get some medications. As you get up, your foot gets
      caught, and you fall to the ground and crumple into a pile. You start to shiver.

    <button class="choice-13">Try to crawl back to the phone to ask the unknown

  <div id="scene-13">
    <p class="scenario">
      Using all of your power, you slowly point your body back towards the phone that
      you put down. On all fours, you crawl forward one step at a time. Your headache
      worsens from moving, and your hand gets stuck on what you tripped on-- a rusted,
      large metal pipe.
    </p>
    <button class="choice-16">Examine the pipe</button>
    <button class="choice-17">Keep crawling back to call for help</button>

  <div id="scene-14">
    <p class="scenario">
      "Thank you," the man whispers, and ends the call. You get up to start your
      investigation, but crumple to the ground the second you stand up. Your
      headache is unbearable. You start to lose consciousness.

      As you force yourself up again, your vision goes black. The last thing you

      Your vision fades in and out as you examine at the pipe. A metallic smell hits your
